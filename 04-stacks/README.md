# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of **LIFO (Last in First Out)**. This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first. Example: browser history.

## Stack operations

| Operations | Time complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| `pop`      | O(1)            |
| `push`     | O(1)            |
| `peek`     | O(1)            |

## Application of stack

- Undo/Redo
- Browser history
- String reversal

## Stack implementation

Both **array** and **linked list** is great choice for implementing stack. Arrays gives sequence memory benefit, linked list provide dynamic memory allocation but they are not stored sequence in memory.
