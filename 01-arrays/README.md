## Static vs Dynamic Arrays

Static arrays are fixed in size that means they required size of the array at the time creation. Dynamic arrays are not fixed in size they are flexible and the size of the array can be changed.

ðŸ‘‰ In JavaScript Arrays are dynamic.

## Array operations

| Operations | Time complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| `lookup`   | O(1)            |
| `push`     | O(1)            |
| `insert`   | O(n)            |
| `delete`   | O(n)            |
