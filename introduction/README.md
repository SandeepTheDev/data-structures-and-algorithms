Computer science is all about problem solving or more specifically completing task by writing program in programming language. **A algorithm is set of steps a program takes to finish a task**.

Each problem can be solved by using different-different algorithm to find out which algorithm is more sclable when inut grows we use Big O.

Big O is a mathematical notation that represent the relation between time and space required by our algorithm as the input size grows.
