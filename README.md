# Data Structures & Algorithms

Understanding Data Structures & Algorithms is vital for writing efficient computer programs.

Algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to complete a task, data structures are used for storing and organizing data in computer memory so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures can be divided into two categories:

### Linear data structures

In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Some well known linear data structures are:

- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked list

### Non-linear data structures

In non-linear data structures, the elements are not arranged in sequence. Some well known non-linear data structures are:

- Graphs
- Trees
