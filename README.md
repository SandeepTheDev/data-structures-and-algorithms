Understanding Data Structures & Algorithms is vital for writing efficient computer programs.

## Algorithm

Algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to complete a task.

## Data Structures

Data structures are used for storing and organizing data in computer memory so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures can be **linear** and **non-linear**.

### Common data structures

1. [Arrays](https://github.com/isandeepbansal/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/01-array)

2. [Hash Tables](https://github.com/isandeepbansal/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/02-hash-table)

3. [Linked List](https://github.com/isandeepbansal/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/03-linked-list)

4. [Stacks](https://github.com/isandeepbansal/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/main/data-structures/04-stack)
