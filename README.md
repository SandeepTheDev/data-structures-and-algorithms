# Introduction

Computer science is all about problem solving.

Understanding Data Structures & Algorithms is vital for writing efficient computer programs.

**Algorithm is a set of steps a program takes to complete a task**. and **Data structures are used for storing and organizing data in computer memory so that it can be used efficiently**. Data structures can be **linear** and **non-linear**.

## 1. Array Data structure

Array is a collection of values (elements) stored in a contiguous memory locations.

### Static vs Dynamic Arrays

Static arrays are fixed in size that means they required size of the array at the time creation. Dynamic arrays are not fixed in size they are flexible and the size of the array can be changed.

ðŸ‘‰ In JavaScript Arrays are dynamic.

### Array operations

| Operations                | Time complexity |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `lookup`                  | O(1)            |
| `push`                    | O(1)            |
| `pop`                     | O(1)            |
| `insert` (shift, unshift) | O(n)            |
| `delete`                  | O(n)            |

### Array problems

1. [Reverse string: create a function that reverses a string](https://github.com/SandeepTheDev/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/data-structures/01-array/exercise/reverse-string.js)

2. [Merge sorted array: write a function that merge two sorted array of integers](https://github.com/SandeepTheDev/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/data-structures/01-array/exercise/merge-sorted-array.js)

## 2. Hash table Data structure

Hash table is a data structure that consists a **key** - **value** pair. **Hash function** is a function that generate a **hash value** or **hash** for a **key** to store and retrieve the corresponding data (value). Hash function takes a **key** as input and generates a memory location where data is stored. **Unlike array hash table's elements are not stored in contiguous memory location**.

- In Javascript object keys are always string.

- Javascript's **Map** allows any data type as a key.
