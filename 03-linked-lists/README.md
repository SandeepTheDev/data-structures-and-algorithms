# Linked List

Linked list is also a **linear data structure**, unlike arrays the **elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations**. Linked list consist of **nodes**, and each node has a **value** and **reference** to next node or null.

## Linked list operations

| Operations | Time complexity |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| `append`   | O(1)            |
| `prepend`  | O(1)            |
| `insert`   | O(n)            |
| `delete`   | O(n)            |
